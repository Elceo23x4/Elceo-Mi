# Final Production Status Report (C6-A12)

_Date: 2026-05-16_

## Overall status
ELCEO backend foundation is **ready for the next phase** (UI integration + staged activation planning) once validation gates pass.

This is **not** final production launch approval.

## C6-A12 final backend foundation status
- Backend foundation consolidation through C6-A11I is complete.
- Live provider activation remains blocked by design pending env keys, approvals, and live smoke tests.
- Hosting/staging/live testing is not yet completed.
- UI integration is not yet completed.
- KoraPay remains readiness shell status until activation + verified webhook/idempotency flow.
- Notification system remains readiness shell status until provider activation and live delivery verification.
- Super Admin metrics remain fixture/estimated until live billing/payment materialization.
- Observability is internal readiness only; no external vendor export integration yet.
- Provider activation requires environment keys and explicit operational approval.
- Production launch is not approved until hosting/staging/security smoke and attack drills complete.

## Truth constraints
- Do not label fixture/dry-run systems as live.
- Do not claim live payment revenue availability.
- Do not claim live email/WhatsApp notification delivery.
- Do not claim external AI model-provider runtime dependency.

## Current readiness class
- Backend foundation: **Ready for pre-activation phase progression**.
- Live operations: **Blocked pending activation gates**.
- Production launch: **No-go until deployment + security + smoke evidence is complete**.

## Post-C6-P1 update (2026-05-16)
- Route-level entitlement enforcement is being completed before any UI work.
- Kick off is limited to: dashboard.chart, dashboard.evidence_score, dashboard.macro_headlines, journal.page.
- Focus Plan is required for premium surfaces; expired trial returns subscription_required wall.
- Restricted users are denied before trial/gift/paid entitlement evaluation.
- Admin/internal routes remain separate and require internal token + admin/super-admin gates.
- Live providers/payments/notifications remain blocked in this phase.
- Route inventory and unresolved families are tracked in docs/route-entitlement-enforcement-map.md.


## Post-C6-P1B runtime enforcement update (2026-05-16)
- Implemented runtime foundation artifacts: typed route entitlement map and shared route entitlement helper.
- Implemented route-level runtime denial contract on checkout for payment-readiness and blocked live activation.
- Representative runtime map coverage is implemented; broad family completion remains tracked as needs_follow_up/policy-only where not yet wired.
- Route-runtime and lower-level tests were added for the new map/helper foundation.

## Post-C6-P1D update
- Added representative commercial runtime guards for /api/analytics/latest, /api/coaching/latest, /api/portfolio/watchlist (GET/POST), and /api/notifications/summary via guardRouteCommercialEntitlement.
- Status: commercial_runtime_guarded (representative only).
- requireFeatureAccess remains separate feature-permission layer from commercial entitlement.
- Remaining families: needs_follow_up for full runtime commercial snapshot binding beyond test header fixtures.


## Post-C6-P1E (2026-05-17)
- Final route-family audit completed for product-facing families.
- Commercial runtime guarded (confirmed): analytics, coaching, portfolio watchlist (GET/POST), notifications summary.
- Feature-permission guarded only: workspace family.
- Helper/lower-level tested: dashboard, journal, billing checkout payment-readiness and live-block, frontend contracts/mock payload families.
- Route runtime tested: admin/internal/scheduled-ingestion/operator-inspection/observability audit representative handlers.
- Policy only: account/profile, auth, provider activation, super-admin metrics.
- Needs follow-up: market-evidence product-facing route family classification remains policy-ambiguous without new public handlers.
- Not present: public SEO/programmatic route family and dedicated KoraPay public checkout route family.
- `requireFeatureAccess` remains separate from commercial entitlement runtime guards.
- Live provider/payment/notification activation remains blocked in this phase.
- No UI changes were made in Post-C6-P1E.
- Enforcement status: representative runtime enforcement complete with documented follow-up families (not full exhaustive route-runtime simulation).

## Post-C6-P2 (2026-05-17) core intelligence commercial guard closure
- Scope: market-evidence/admin-intelligence route re-audit, dashboard/journal/frontend-contract route classification only; no UI changes, no provider/payment/notification live activation.
- User-facing market-evidence premium intelligence routes are currently not present; existing market-evidence handlers are admin/internal and remain gated by internal/admin guard layers.
- Dashboard kick-off allowlist remains limited to dashboard.chart, dashboard.evidence_score, dashboard.macro_headlines; premium cognition remains Focus Plan required.
- Journal basic page remains kick-off allowed; deep-analysis/cognition-linked journal routes are not present and remain documented as not_present.
- Public SEO product-intelligence routes remain not_present; admin SEO feed/sitemap routes remain internal/admin-only.
- Feature-permission gates and commercial entitlement gates remain separate and both required where applicable.


## Post-C6-P3 account/profile + notification ownership update (2026-05-17)
- Scope: backend route ownership and payment-readiness guard updates only; no UI changes.
- Focus Plan checkout readiness now enforces social identifiers (linkedin_address, telegram_id, x_username) before eligibility; missing identifiers return `payment_readiness_blocked` + `missing_social_identifier`; liveActivation remains blocked.
- Notification preference foundation remains shell-only (no live email/WhatsApp sends) and owner boundary is enforced for subscription mutation routes.
- Account/profile routes remain authenticated-basic where present; profile/social identifier CRUD route now exists at /api/account/profile/social-identifiers (GET/PATCH), authenticated + owner-scoped; persistence is durable when APP_STATE_REPOSITORY=sql with DATABASE_URL; otherwise explicit memory_fallback persists only for test/local runtime.
- No live KoraPay/Stripe checkout created; no live provider activation.


## Post-C6-P4 update (2026-05-17)
- Added internal-only admin commercial control route foundations for gift/retract/restrict and control snapshot under `/api/admin/commercial/users/[userId]/*`.
- Mutation routes require internal token, `admin.ops`, security decision/idempotency/audit flow, and verified step-up contract checks.
- Step-up state remains **fixture/readiness** (`fixture_verified_for_tests` / `step_up_readiness_only`); production 2FA provider wiring is pending.
- IP ban is explicitly rejected; user restriction supports only `suspended` or `banned`.
- No UI changes, no payment provider activation/calls, no checkout/session activation, no notification sends.
- Persistence caveat: super-admin commercial control records are currently in-memory foundation state, not durable production storage.

## Post-C6-P5 Update (2026-05-18)
- Super Admin gift/restrict persistence now supports SQL durability when `APP_STATE_REPOSITORY=sql` and `DATABASE_URL` are configured; otherwise explicit `memory_fallback`.
- Step-up/2FA classification: `provider_pending` (readiness only, fixture verification in tests).
- Routes remain backend-only; no Admin UI wiring done.
- No payment provider, notification, or live 2FA activation in this batch.
- IP ban remains intentionally unsupported.


## Post-C6-P6 (2026-05-18)
- Added production step-up/2FA contract foundation: challenge creation, verification, freshness window, replay protection, rate-limit/lockout policy, and safe audit metadata.
- Provider readiness remains blocked: totp/webauthn/authenticator_app are provider_pending; fixture_test_only is test-mode only.
- Super Admin commercial mutation routes still require verified step-up and do not expose OTP/proof/token secrets.
- Persistence status for step-up challenge runtime is memory_fallback; durable provider activation remains deferred.
- No UI work, no payment/provider/notification live activation in this batch.

## C6-R0 — Market Realism Truth-Source Audit (2026-06-03)

- Market-realism audit status: completed for C6-R0 as a documentation/truth-source foundation.
- No UI was built or modified in this batch.
- No live provider activation was performed; fixture, dry-run, and not-started provider states remain explicitly tracked.
- No live payments, live notifications, commercial entitlement behavior, Super Admin behavior, or 2FA/step-up behavior were changed.
- Reasoning gaps are now formally tracked in `docs/market-realism-truth-source-map.md` and `docs/market-realism-code-gap-audit.md`.
- R1-R9 remain required before ELCEO can claim final market-intelligence realism: asset-contextual direction, FX relative pressure, macro surprise normalization, expanded contradictions, confidence calibration, price reaction/impulse confirmation, provider reliability weighting, golden scenario expansion, and integrated acceptance gates.

## C6-R1 production status note (2026-06-03)

- Asset causality mapping is now a typed, schema-validated, tested foundation for all ELCEO launch assets.
- This improves production readiness documentation and contract coverage only; it does not activate live providers or complete downstream market-realism engines.
- R2-R9 remain required before ELCEO can claim final market-intelligence realism.
- No UI, live payment, live notification, commercial entitlement, Super Admin, or 2FA behavior changed.

## C6-R2 — Asset-contextual direction resolver foundation (2026-06-03)

- Added a deterministic asset-contextual direction resolver foundation for reasoning internals.
- Generic metadata direction mapping is no longer the primary weighted-evidence contribution path; the same event can resolve differently by asset through causality map context, asset family, FX orientation, driver kind, policy/risk tone, and caveat flags.
- Open loops remain: R3 FX relative strength, R4 macro surprise normalization, R5 expanded contradiction matrix, R6 confidence calibration, R7 price reaction/impulse, provider reliability, and golden scenario expansion.
- No UI, live provider, payment, notification, commercial entitlement, Super Admin, affiliate, or 2FA behavior changed.

## C6-R2B — Direction resolver issuer-ambiguity cleanup (2026-06-03)

- Corrected the C6-R2 policy issuer ambiguity so missing policy issuer metadata no longer defaults to Fed/U.S. direction pressure.
- Explicit Fed metadata still resolves asset-contextually, and weighted-evidence tests now verify differing contribution signs for DXY versus EUR/USD.
- Non-Fed issuer-side expansion remains limited and pending with later issuer-side/R3 FX relative-strength work; R3/R4/R5/R6/R7 remain pending.
- No UI, live provider, payment, notification, commercial, Super Admin, route entitlement, or 2FA behavior changed.

## C6-R3 — FX relative currency strength engine foundation (2026-06-03)

- Added typed, schema-validated, tested FX relative currency strength foundation for all seven ELCEO launch FX pairs.
- FX reasoning now has a base-vs-quote pressure model; missing base or quote evidence lowers confidence and remains visible in warnings/reason codes.
- Non-Fed issuer side handling is improved for ECB/EUR, BoE/GBP, BoJ/JPY, SNB/CHF, RBA/AUD, RBNZ/NZD, and BoC/CAD, while missing issuer remains ambiguous.
- C6-R3B safety cleanup: unsupported/non-FX weighted snapshots no longer default to EUR/USD; weighted-snapshot FX relative-strength reconstruction is diagnostic/limited because original issuer/currency metadata may be reduced, so evidence-item inputs remain preferred for full FX side attribution and DXY remains limited diagnostic.
- Macro surprise normalization remains R4; expanded contradiction matrix remains R5; confidence calibration remains R6; price reaction/impulse remains R7; provider reliability/golden scenarios remain pending.
- No UI, live provider, payment, notification, commercial, Super Admin, affiliate, route entitlement, or 2FA behavior changed.

## C6-R4 production-status note — macro surprise normalization (2026-06-03)

C6-R4 added a fixture-only/read-only macro surprise normalization engine. It improves market realism by making actual-vs-forecast the primary macro comparison and by preserving indicator-specific interpretation for inflation, labor, growth/activity, and policy-rate decisions. It does not activate live providers, payments, notifications, or frontend payload changes. R5/R6/R7/provider reliability remain pending.

## C6-R5 production-status note — Expanded contradiction matrix (2026-06-04)

C6-R5 added a deterministic expanded contradiction matrix foundation and read-only canonical boundary methods. The matrix broadens contradiction/tension detection beyond the old four market-cognition pairs and now covers policy-vs-risk, rates-vs-gold, FX base/quote, risk-vs-volatility, risk-vs-credit, equities-vs-breadth, crypto-vs-derivatives/liquidity, commodity cross-asset, safe-haven conflict, macro-vs-price-confirmation, stale/fresh conflict, and source disagreement. Contradiction is uncertainty context, not automatic reversal and not financial advice. R6 confidence calibration, R7 price reaction/impulse, provider reliability weighting, and golden scenario expansion remain pending. No UI, live provider, payment, notification, commercial, billing, Super Admin, affiliate, route-entitlement, or 2FA behavior changed.
