# Provider Live Activation Readiness (C5-A21)

C5-A21 introduces staging-only live provider activation planning gates.

- Canonical contracts added for activation policy, readiness status, readiness snapshot, quota policy, and smoke plan.
- Production live ingestion remains blocked by default.
- No scheduler, no cron, no live ingestion enablement in production.
- Tiingo staging readiness requires explicit live enablement plus API key.
- Helpers return no secrets and perform no network calls.
- Smoke plans are planning artifacts only and gate on staging-ready status.
- C5-A22 will build scheduled ingestion orchestration on top of these contracts.

## C5-A22 note
- Added scheduled ingestion orchestration foundation with dry-run fixture jobs, persisted run records, query/replay helpers, deterministic retry/staleness helpers, and production-live blocked by default.
- No cron deployment and no live provider calls by default in this batch.


## C5-A23 note
- Added protected internal/admin scheduled-ingestion routes: policies/runs/replay (GET) and dry-run (POST).
- Dry-run POST is internal+admin.ops gated with mutation security decision, idempotency, rate-limit, audit, and response-envelope completion.
- Route input rejects production_live override and provider API key fields; fixture dry-run only.
- No public routes, no cron deployment, and no live provider calls in this batch.

## C5-A24 backend consolidation linkage
- See `docs/c5-market-evidence-backend-readiness-report.md` for consolidated C5 backend readiness truth source.
- Live ingestion remains blocked-by-default; cron deployment and public SEO route launch remain deferred.
- Production go/no-go still requires security verification track, staging smoke, and production smoke.
- DB migrations must be applied in strict lexicographic order (including `0032`, `0033`, `0034`).
- Known non-blocking warnings remain tracked; do not treat them as launch-complete signals.
\n## C6-A1 update (2026-05-14)\n- Added canonical provider/source registry snapshot + validators + boundary methods.\n- Registry is fixture/dry-run readiness only; no live calls and no API keys.\n- Live activation remains blocked-by-default for every source.\n- C6-A2 remains the next step for launch-asset fixture expansion.\n

## RC-F Provider API Gate foundation (2026-07-08)
- Canonical Provider API Gate boundary introduced for provider/source/capability/adapter resolution before execution. Canonical source IDs remain descriptor IDs such as `tiingo_market_data`; capabilities remain registry capabilities such as `market_price_history`; adapter IDs are derived gate IDs such as `tiingo_market_data_market_price_history_adapter`.
- Activation modes are `disabled`, `fixture_only`, `dry_run`, `replay`, `staging_live_allowed`, and `production_live_allowed`. Default resolution is `dry_run`; blocked/live behavior remains default unless explicit staging/production allow policy is supplied. `production_live_allowed` is never default and requires an explicit production allow flag.
- Provider call modes are fixture response, dry-run no external call, replay captured payload, staging live, production live, or blocked live. Fixture/dry-run/replay paths require provenance and response validation contracts and do not require live credentials.
- Policy foundation covers request quotas, provider rate-limit windows, capability cost budgets, cache hit/miss, request dedupe/coalescing by normalized request, circuit open/half-open/closed, and stale-if-error only when explicitly allowed.
- Unmanaged provider calls from reasoning, ingestion, admin, scheduled, or operator paths are prohibited. Direct adapters may exist only behind the Provider API Gate or as fixture/dry-run/replay descriptors.
- RC-H remains responsible for live-provider payload validation and staging smoke with real credentials. This document does not claim live provider readiness.
- RC-G database rehearsal remains required before relying on durable provider orchestration state beyond current memory/SQL repository contracts.
